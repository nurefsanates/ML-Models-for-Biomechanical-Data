# ML-Models-for-Biomechanical-Data
This repository contains a detailed exploration of the "Biomechanical features of orthopedic patients" dataset from Kaggle. 
Various machine learning algorithms were applied to classify the biomechanical characteristics of patients, including:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
